## Installation

You have two installation options in order to use the InLive JavaScript SDK. You can either use a package manager to install the SDK or use the CDN links available.

### Option 1: Install with package managers (recommended)

You can install the InLive JavaScript SDK using package managers such as [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inlivedev/inlive-js-sdk), [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/package/@inlivedev/inlive-js-sdk), or [pnpm](https://pnpm.io). For most users, this is the recommended choice.

**Install with npm**

```bash
$ npm install @inlivedev/inlive-js-sdk
```

The SDK package will be downloaded and installed. Then, you're ready to import it into your code.

### Option 2: Use CDN links available

The InLive JavaScript SDK is also available via CDN links.

**Access via jsdelivr**

Access the latest version.

```bash
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@inlivedev/inlive-js-sdk/dist/inlive-js-sdk.js
```

Access the specific version. You may change the version based on the release version number on NPM.

```bash
https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@inlivedev/inlive-js-sdk@0.4.3/dist/inlive-js-sdk.js
```

The above links use [jsdelivr](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@inlivedev/inlive-js-sdk@latest/). But you can also use any CDN that serves npm packages. Other alternatives are [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/browse/@inlivedev/inlive-js-sdk@latest/), and [jspm](https://jspm.dev/@inlivedev/inlive-js-sdk). You can also download the file and serve it yourself.
